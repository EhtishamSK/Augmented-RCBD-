This R script implements an Augmented Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) analysis for evaluating the effects of different genotypes on various traits in an unbalanced experimental design. The script begins by installing and loading necessary packages, including augmentedRCBD for conducting the analysis. After setting the working directory, it imports the data from an Excel file and preprocesses it by converting relevant columns to factors. The number of unique genotypes and blocks is determined, and a list of trait names is compiled for analysis. The augmentedRCBD.bulk function is then utilized to perform the ANOVA, specifying parameters for block and treatment variables, along with other options for descriptive statistics and graphical outputs. Finally, a detailed report of the ANOVA results, adjusted means, variance component, and heritability (broad sense) is generated and saved as a Word document, providing insights into the genotype effects on the measured traits.
